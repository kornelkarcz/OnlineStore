OnlineStore

My project is an online application that enables user to purchase products from a given set.

The project was developed during Java JEE bootcamp at CodersLab. The project was developed individually by myself. The idea of this project was to tap all tools and knowledge that was gained during the bootcamp. Therefore, I wanted to develop a project that would give an opportunity to save and retrieve data from created database.

The OnlineStore enables the end user to register, log and conduct the whole process of purchasing good.

The project is still being developed further and new feature are still added.

The one of the most important feature that I would like to add in the future is tha possibility of leasing products instead of traditional purchase. The inspiration for developing this feature is increasing popularity of subscription business model.

 The project was developed basing mainly on Java, Spring and Hibernate Frameworks.
